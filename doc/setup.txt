In kav_wiz.c, do_relevel there are places for your gods to be set as 
imps there. By adding your self here you can type relevel and be releved to 
an imp.I hope you enjoy. Also search for NONAME throught the code..you should put
your imps name in the NONAME places. If you use grep rember it is case sensitive so 
grep NONAME *.c will find you all the NONAME places. :)
