-1 LORDSOFWAR LORDS SAGE~
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Lords of War code was created by Sage, Lords of War is written on
God Wars which was created by KaVir. I would like to thank the 
following people. This is in order of how much they helped me.

-KaVir for making the God Wars code for me to work off.
-Order for being a good friend and helping me to create low 4.
-Malawar for his cool additions.
-Tijer for helping me with the finishing touches.
-Dunkirk for code help.
-Sirmog for code help.
-The players for inspiring me.
-The Merc/Diku team for making the code base.

This mud is dedicated to KaVir for his hard work. KaVir aka Richard
Woolcock has spent more time then you can imagine making muds for
players to play. God Wars, Dark City, God Wars Deluxe, and now Last
City. Every time you play a God Wars mud try and take some time
and rember who made it all possible. This mud is not a very good
dedication seeing as it is not the perfect mud, but it is the best
I could do at the moment. KaVir is a great coder and most of all
a great person. I would like to say Thanks KaVir!
-Sage
Rember don't ever become like (POH), the stolen orginal Lords of War
code renamed. The mud is an insult to all coders and players due
to his lack of respect. This mud was coded for you players, rember
that. Much time and work went into this game for you. Enjoy.
This code is ftpable from ftp.game.org. Please read and follow the
low.txt, merc.txt and godwars.txt I have enclosed. If these are not
followed you are running an illegal mud. Have fun! :) Sage

help aeolus.
~


0 STATCAPS~
There is a 11k stat cap on HP MANA and MOVE.

Above this, bonus' are givin for Player Status, and Legend Status.

Each Legend Status raises your Cap by 1k.

Each Player Status raises your Cap by 200.
~


0 LEGEND LEGENDS~

Syntax: train legend
Syntax: train   (alone, to see what the costs are for Legend Status)

Legend Status is how well known you are in the world. As you gain Legend
Status, your character becomes stronger.  Fame also confers to its
possessor extra skills not familiar to the unknown.  See LCOMMANDS for
more information.  The cost of Legend Status increases as you gain more
fame. Legend Status costs both experience points and quest points to
train.


The difference of Legend Status between each person fighting is the amount of
extra attacks per round the person with more Legend Status gets. For instance,
Mike with 5 Legend Status, attacks Joe with 2 Legend Status. Mike will get
3 extra attacks per round. 

Legend Status   Damcap Affects
1  - Citizen    50
2  - Legend     100
3  - Myth       200
4  - Titan      300
5  - Immortal   400
6  - Oracle     500
7  - Demigod    1000
8  - Deity      1500
9  - Almighty   2000

Legend status also affects HP MANA and MOVE caps. Help statcaps for
details.

0 MONK MONKS~

Monks are servants of God.  They are masters of the body and spirit.
Defensive in nature, a monk spends his or her life practicing the
mystical arts.  God grants monks special abilities that allow
them to compete with the evil Supernatual creatures they aim
to smite.
For more in depth information, See the following helps:
MONKABILITIES, MONKCHI, MONKBLOCK, MONKCOMBO, MONKFOCUS
~

0 MONKCHI~

A monk's chi is the essential part of combat.  The higher
the monk's chi, the better he or she can parry and dodge
blows.  It also gives the monk more strength and power,
thus letting him or her inflict more damage and receive
less.  Maintaining chi is very strenuous, and requires
that the monk have plenty of vitality.
~

0 MONKCOMBO~

By using his or her special techniques, such as thrust kick,
in a certain order, he or she may perform special combos.
Each combo has a different effect.  Some may do damage to the
victim, some syphon movement points, and some may stun the victim.
A monk's combos are a very mysterious thing, thus the monk
must spend much of his or her life trying to perfect
these combos.
~

0 MONKBLOCK~

A monk's block counter allows him to parry blows much better.
This counter increments whenever a monk parries a blow.
The max block counter is 150, and the higher it gets, the
better the monk parries.  After the fight stops, the block
counter will soon reset to 0.
~

0 MONKFOCUS~

Elite monks have the ability to focus the power of God
into his or her own special attacks.  After a monk has
gained focus points, he or she must use them to perform
special attacks that have devastating effects.  The only
downside to these attacks is that it takes a monk a
very long time to recover the focus required to do such
extraordinary feats.
~

0 MONKABILITIES~
Monks have four special abilities granted to them by God.
Each ability has four levels, which cost 500k exp each.
For more info on the Abilities,
See Help: 'MONKSPIRIT' 'MONKCOMBAT' 'MONKBODY' and 'MONKAWARENESS'
~

0 MONKSPIRIT~

Level 1 - Blinding Agony. This power allows the monk to hurl
a ball of pure evil at a foe.  It blinds the foe, and prevents
him or her to flee or recall.

Level 2 - Natural Harmony (auto).  This power allows the monk to
absorb the evil of someone who attacks him or her and channel
them into energy, which heals the Monk.

Level 3 - Healing Touch.  This power allows the monk to imbue his
target with the essence of God, healing his or her wounds.

Level 4 - Death Touch. This power allows the monk to give his victim a
deadly disease which cripples and wounds him or her.
~

0 MONKAWARENESS~

Level 1 - Nightsight

Level 2 - Shadowsight

Level 3 - Truesight

Level 4 - Scry
~

0 MONKBODY~

Level 1 - Adamantium Hands.  This power allows the monk's hands to become
incredibly hard, like adamantium.  This allows the monk to do more damage
and parry blows with his or her bare hands.

Level 2 - Body of Stone (Auto).  At this mastery of the body, the monk's
body is as hard as a stone, causing him or her to take reduced damage.

Level 3 - Spiritpower.  This power allows the monk to channel his or her
energy into offensive attacks, significantly raising his or her hitroll
and damroll.

Level 4 - The Glow (Auto).  Only a true master of the body has this
ability.  The monk's power is so great that his or her hands glow
brightly with the power of God and the monk's holy spirit.  The 
effect of this glow is varied, but often dangerous.

~

0 MONKCOMBAT~

This ability improves the monk's combat ability per level.
Each level gives the monk more knowledge of combat,
allowing him or her to do more damage, hit more often, and
parry and dodge more.
~
0 MONKCOUNTER~

The monk's block counter is a very important part of a monk's blocking.
The block counter increases everytime a monk parries a blow.  The
higher a monk's block counter, the better the monk can parry blows.
The block counter resets shortly after fights.
~

0 DAMAGE~
When someone attacks someone else, a damage message is displayed to give 
you an idea of how much damage you have caused.  The following messages 
represent the following amounts of damage.

If you missed, then you did 0 points of damage.
If you lightly hit, then you did 1 to 25 points of damage.   
If you hit kinda hard, then you did 26 to 50 points of damage.
If you hit hard, then you did 51 to 100 points of damage.
If you hit very hard, then you did 101 to 250 points of damage.
If you hit extremely hard, then you did 251 to 500 points of damage.
If you hit incredibly hard, then you did 501 to 1000 points of damage.
If you hit amazingly hard, then you did 1001 to 1500 points of damage.
If you hit insanely hard, then you did more than 1501 points of damage.

Your final blow will be a death move, depending on your weapon type.

0 CLAIM CALL GIFT LOCATE~
Syntax: claim <object>
Syntax: call <object>
Syntax: call all
Syntax: gift <object> <player>
Syntax: locate

By claiming an object (which costs 500 exp), that object becomes your 
personal property.  Using the 'locate' command you can find what items 
currently belong to you and where they are in the mud.  If you are not 
carrying the item, you can get it back by calling it with the 'call' 
command.  You can change the ownership of your own items by use of the 
'gift' command.

0 DECAPITATE~
Do this to another avatar when they are mortally wounded, and you will 
suck out some of their lifeforce (represented by 1000exp), making them 
mortal again.  You may also loot their corpse, of course, and if you are 
hungry you can even eat their head ;)
Decapitation alone is not enough to completely destroy another avatar 
however, for their head will retain their remaining lifeforce.  To truely 
kill them, you must crack open their head and eat (or in some other way 
destroy) their brain.
~



0 CRACK~
While holding a head in either your left or right hand, typing 'crack' 
will crack the head open, spilling the brains out onto the floor.
~



0 DEATH~
When your character dies, you are reincarnated back at the Altar of the Temple
of Midgaard.  Your corpse is left behind in the room where you were killed,
together with all of your equipment.  Your gold stays with you.

Any spells which were affecting you are canceled by death.

Following and groups are not affected by death.

You lose experience points for dying.  The amount you lose is half of your 
current amount, so it's a good idea not to hoard exp.

Corpses decay after time, and the objects inside corpses decay with them.
Player corpses last *roughly* 30 hours of game time (15 minutes of real time).
~



0 ESCAPE~
This command allows you to transport to the temple of midgaard when 
mortally wounded.  Unfortunately, it also reduces both your mana and move 
to 0, and informs everyone else on the mud that you are lying defenseless 
at recall...so be careful how you use it.
~



0 MOUNT DISMOUNT~
Syntax: mount <creature>
Syntax: dismount

This allows the character to mount the specified creature.  Only 
creatures such as horses and the like may be mounted, and they will aid 
their rider in combat.

For information on the MOUNT spell, type 'help mountspell'.
~



0 QUESTS~
Quest Makers (and occasionally higher levels) can set quests for one or 
more players to participate in.  The rewards for such quests can be in 
the form of specially modified equipment.  A number of quest points-worth 
will be allocated depending on the difficulty of the quest, using the 
following guidelines for point costs (QP's = Quest Points):

Stats (Str/Dex/Int/Wis/Con): 20 QP's per +1, max allowed is +3 per stat.
Hp/Mana/Move: 5 QP per +1, max allowed is +25 on each.
Hitroll/Damroll: 30 QP's per +1, max allowed is +5 on each.
Ac: 10 QP's per -1, max allowed is -25.

Once a certain affect (str, hitroll, ac, etc) is selected, it cannot be 
chosen again for that item even if you didn't select the maximum allowed 
amount.  Choosing to have penalties on an item will not decrease its 
cost, although some Quest Makers may allow extra points if you select a 
few disadvantages on the item.

For more information, type 'quest'.
~



0 QUEST TOKEN~
Syntax: quest <field> <value>
Syntax: token <value>

QUEST will allow you to spend any quest points you might have.  For a 
list of the cost (in quest points), type 'quest'.

TOKEN will allow you to create a quest token, with the value of the token 
set to the value specified.  The tokens value must be within 1 and 50, 
and it cannot be greater than the number of quest points you currently 
have.

For information on the QUEST spell, type 'help questspell'.
~



0 QUESTCARD COMPLETE RECHARGE~
Syntax: complete card
Syntax: complete card <object>
Syntax: recharge card machine

A quest card requires 4 objects to complete.  To find out what 4 objects 
you need, type 'complete card'.  When you find these items, you should 
type 'complete card <object>'.  Once you have completed all 4 items on 
the card, #yin order#n, you will be told that you have completed the card.  
Then you should go and find the dark crypt, where there is a machine, and 
type 'recharge card machine'.  You will receive a quest token reward, which 
you should eat, and the card will be recharged with 4 new items to find.

HINT:  Vallandar's tomb can be found by going 2 south, 7 east, 2 north 
from recall.  Once you have found that area, you should look for the 
guardian and solve his riddle, enter the portal he creates, and you'll be 
in the dark crypt.
~



0 QUEST-TYPES~
The following are a few examples of quest types:
* Find the object/s.  Examples: Find 5 different coloured potions, Find a 
  pitch black longsword that flames brightly, Find a dragon dagger, belt 
  and bracer, etc.
* Kill the mob/s.  These can be hunt down and kill, or simple placing the 
  player in the same room as the mob/s.  Can also be combined with finding 
  objects - Example: Find and kill two different dragons and bring me 
  their claws.
* Solve a puzzle.  For example find a certain room, solve a riddle in an 
  area, or successfully get out of a maze.  These are particularly good 
  when several players of different ability are competing in the quest.
* Duel: A one-on-one fight pitting either a player against a mob, or 
  (more usually) a player against another player.  The conditions will be 
  decided beforehand, and can include any conditions that both sides 
  agree on.  Example: No sanctuary, no potions (or maybe a limited number),
  no spells, no weapons, or whatever.
* Skirmishes: Like a duel, but involves several players on either side.  
  Although the sides don't have to be equal in number, it is generally a 
  good idea to make sure they are roughly equal in power.
* There are also several more obscure quests that can be run - for 
  example you could require that the player brings you 3 small green 
  eggs, then load mob 30005 into the players room.  Another battle might 
  involve no melee - all combat must be with missile weapons.
~



0 EXPERIENCE XP~
Your character advances in power by gaining experience.

You gain experience by being part of a group that kills someone/something.

You lose experience by dying or being decapitated.

The experience you get from a kill depends on several things: how many players
are in your group; your alignment versus your opponent's alignment; how 
many of this monster have been killed lately (if they are an NPC); and 
some random variation.

See also help on 'status'.
~



0 STATUS~

This represents the 'danger' of the player.  You only have a status if 
you are level 3.  It grants no extra powers, but is a good measure of 
how deadly that player is in combat.  Each time you decapitate an 
Immortal+ (or an Avatar if you are also an Avatar) your status goes up by 
one and their status goes down by one (to a minimum of zero).  The 
following shows how many kills (minus deaths) you need for each status:

     0  = Avatar
10 - 19 = Immortal
20 - 29 = Godling
30 - 39 = Demigod
40 - 49 = Lesser God
50 - 59 = Greater God
60 - 70 = Supreme God
71 +	= Ultimate God
Remember, if your status is Immortal or above you gain nothing for 
decapitating an Avatar (except a free loot, a head, and an enemy).

0 SKILL~
Syntax: skill | skill <player>

This shows the target player's skill with the weapon they are currently 
wielding and the stance they are in (if it's a specialized stance).

~



0 SPELL SPELLS~
Syntax: spells | spell <colour>

This shows your spell casting ability with the various types of magic.

1) Untrained.				 6) An adept.
2) An apprentice.			 7) A mage.
3) A student.				 8) A warlock.
4) A scholar.				 9) A master wizard.
5) A magus.				10) A grand sorcerer.

Note that these are only rough estimates; one master wizard might well be 
slightly more skilled than another master wizard, and so on.
~



0 GODLESS~
By typing this, you will no longer be affected by most god commands, 
including restore, force, slay, mset, transfer, deny, freeze, etc.  You 
can toggle your godless flag on and off at will, and everyone in the mud 
is informed each time you do this.
~



0 HOME~
To set your recall point, enter the desired room and type 'home here'.  
From that point on you will recall to that point rather than the Temple 
of Midgaard (although you still go to the Templar Altar if you die).

A home cannot be a safe room.
~



0 PET PETS~
You can buy pets in the pet shop.  Your pet-buying opportunities do not 
accumulate; use them or lost them.  This policy prevents wholesale abuse 
of pets.
~



0 TICK~
Many of the game actions are based upon interval timers, including combat,
most autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration, spell duration,
weather, and area resetting.

Of these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly called the
'tick'.  Ticks on this mud average 30 seconds of real time, but the actual
amount varies randomly from 15 seconds to 45 seconds.

Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if no one is in the area; less
often (15 minutes) if some one is.  Also note that objects lying on the ground
will not be regenerated if anyone is in the area when it resets.
~



0 !~
Syntax: !

! repeats the last command you typed.
~

0 NORTH SOUTH EAST WEST UP DOWN~
Syntax: north
Syntax: south
Syntax: east
Syntax: west
Syntax: up
Syntax: down

Use these commands to walk in a particular direction.
~

0 CAST~
Syntax: cast <spell> <target>

Before you can cast a spell, you have to practice it.  The more you practice,
the higher chance you have of success when casting.  Casting spells costs mana.
The mana cost decreases as your magical ability increases.

The <target> is optional.  Many spells which need targets will use an
appropriate default target, especially during combat.

If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell name.
Example: cast 'cure critic' frag.  Quoting is optional for single-word spells.
You can abbreviate the spell name.

When you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving throw.
The effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the
saving throw successfully.

See also the help sections for individual spells.
~

0 EXITS~
Syntax: exits

Tells you the visible exits of the room you are in.  Not all exits are visible.
You can use the 'bump' technique to find hidden exits.  (Try to walk in a
certain direction and see what you bump into).
~

0 DROP GET GIVE PUT TAKE~
Syntax: drop <object>
Syntax: drop <amount> coins
Syntax: get  <object>
Syntax: get  <object> <container>
Syntax: give <object> <character>
Syntax: give <amount> coins <character>
Syntax: put  <object> <container>

DROP drops an object, or some coins, on the ground.

GET gets an object, either lying on the ground, or from a container, or even
from a corpse.  TAKE is a synonym for get.

GIVE gives an object, or some coins, to another character.

PUT puts an object into a container.

DROP, GET and PUT understand the object names 'ALL' for all objects and
'ALL.object' for all objects with the same name.
~

0 EQUIPMENT INVENTORY~
Syntax: equipment
Syntax: inventory

EQUIPMENT lists your equipment (armor, weapons, and held items).
INVENTORY lists your inventory.
~

0 COMPARE~
Syntax: compare <object-1> <object-2>
Syntax: compare <object>

COMPARE compares two objects in your inventory.  If both objects are weapons,
it will report the one with the better average damage.  If both objects are
armor, it will report the one with the better armor class.

COMPARE with one argument compares an object in your inventory to the object
you are currently wearing or wielding of the same type.

COMPARE doesn't consider any special modifiers of the objects.
~

0 BACKSTAB BERSERK BS DISARM KICK PUNCH KILL~
Syntax: backstab <character>
Syntax: berserk
Syntax: disarm
Syntax: kick
Syntax: punch    <character>
Syntax: kill     <character>

KILL starts a fight, and, hopefully, kills something.  BACKSTAB is another way
to start a fight, used by thieves.  BS is a synonym for BACKSTAB.

BERSERK will make you strike out at every creature in the room.  It will 
hit players as well as mobiles, so it's a good idea not to use this skill 
while you are grouped.
DISARM is an auxiliary fighting command to disarm your opponent.  Similarly,
KICK will inflict more damage during combat by kicking.
PUNCH will inflict a small amount of damage, and stun your opponent for a 
short period of time.  It also has a chance of breaking your opponents 
nose or jaw.

In order to BACKSTAB, DISARM, KICK or PUNCH successfully, you must practice
the appropriate skill.
~

0 FASTDRAW~

FASTDRAW is automatic, if you have it.  If another player attacks you 
while you have any sheathed weapons, you will draw them out with 
lightning speed and strike your opponent before they are able to land any 
blows on you.  If you have any items in your hands at the time, you will 
throw them aside before drawing your weapons.
~


0 STANCE~
Syntax: combat <style>

In combat, the stance of the fighter plays a very important role; you 
can't just stand there and exchange blow for blow unless you are very 
confident of your ability.  Each fighting stance has advantages and 
disadvantages, the basic outline of which follows:
VIPER: A very fast and aggressive style of combat, concentrating on 
striking your opponent before they have the chance to avoid or block you.
CRANE: A wide, sweeping style of combat, which concentrates on a very 
strong blocking defence.
CRAB: A low, defensive fighting stance which uses agile footwork and 
rolling with attacks in order to reduce your injuries.
MONGOOSE: A light-footed stance, which relies on leaps and acrobatics to 
ensure that by the time your opponent makes their attack, you've moved 
out of the way.
BULL: A low aggressive stance which concentrates purely on physical power.

See also help on 'advancedstance' 'superstance' and 'stancetable'.
~

0 ADVANCEDSTANCE~
Syntax: combat <style>

Advanced stances can be learned after you have become a grand master in 
two normal stances.  These stances are much better than the others.
MANTIS: Requires CRANE and VIPER before it can be learned.  This stance 
combines a very strong defence with lightning fast counter attacks.
DRAGON: Requires BULL and CRAB before it can be learned.  This stance 
uses very powerful attacks, as well as protecting the fighter from injury.
TIGER: Requires BULL and VIPER before it can be learned.  Probably the 
most aggressive of all the stances, this style utilizes very powerful and
lightning fast attacks.
MONKEY: Requires CRANE and MONGOOSE before it can be learned.  The only 
affect of this stance is to completely nullify the advantages of your 
opponents stance.
SWALLOW: Requires MONGOOSE and CRAB before it can be learned.  This is 
the most defensive of all the stances, combining agile dodges with the 
ability to 'roll' with an attack, helping prevent injury.

See also help on 'stance' and 'stancetable'.
~

0 SUPERSTANCE~
Superstances are for people who have mastered all other stances.
Eagle: Requires Swallow and Tiger.
Bear: Requires Swallow and Dragon.
Cougar: Requires Mantis and Dragon.
Cobra: Requires Tiger and Dragon.
Rabbit: Requires Swallow and Monkey.

These stances will help to aid a player in combat.

~
0 STANCETABLE~

The following table is a rough comparison of stances, giving a value 
between 10 and -10, where the higher the number the better your chance of 
victory.  Cross-reference your stance from the left with your opponents 
stance from along the top.  Please remember these are only rough 
estimates, and may not be completely accurate...

0 FIGHT STYLE FIGHTSTYLE~
Syntax: fightstyle <number> <style>

This is used for unarmed combat, and it allows the fighter to decide on 
their style of unarmed attack.  Many different types of attack are 
possible, each with different advantages and disadvantages.  Your first 
attack in combat always uses the first number slot.  If you have a second 
attack, this will draw a fighting technique from slots 1 to 4.  If you 
have a third attack, it will draw a fighting technique from slots 5 to 
8.  Any other attacks are randomly drawn from any of slots 1 to 8.  If 
the slot is blank (0) then the attack is a standard unarmed attack.
~

0 HURL~
Syntax: hurl <name>
Syntax: hurl <name> <direction>

This ability allows you to hurl the target into walls, through exits, or 
through doors.  Hurling someone through an exit does a little damage.  
Hurling them into walls does twice as much, and hurling them through 
doors does three times as much.  If you don't specify a direction to hurl 
the target, it will be random (north, south, east or west).  You cannot 
hurl someone who is already injured.
~

0 SCAN SPY THROW~
Syntax: scan
Syntax: spy   <direction>
Syntax: throw <direction> <target>

SCAN allows you to see all the mobs/players within 1 room of you.

SPY allows you to see all the mobs/players within 3 rooms in a specified 
direction.

THROW allows you to hurl an object you are holding (in your right hand, 
or if that's empty left hand) to a target mob/player in a specified 
direction.  The object can be throw up to 3 rooms.  If it fails to reach 
the target by that time it will land on the floor.

For information on the SCAN spell, type 'help scanspell'.
~

0 FLEE RESCUE~
Syntax: flee
Syntax: rescue   <character>

Once you start a fight, you can't just walk away from it.  If the fight
is not going well, you can attempt to FLEE, or another character can
RESCUE you.  (You can also RECALL, but this is less likely to work,
and costs more experience points, then fleeing).

If you lose your link during a fight, then your character will keep
fighting, and will attempt to RECALL from time to time.  Your chances
of making the recall are reduced, and you will lose much more experience.

In order to RESCUE successfully, you must practice the appropriate skill.
~

0 EXAMINE LOOK~
Syntax: look
Syntax: look    <object>
Syntax: look    <character>
Syntax: look    <direction>
Syntax: look    <keyword>
Syntax: look in <container>
Syntax: look in <corpse>
Syntax: examine <container>
Syntax: examine <corpse>

LOOK looks at something and sees what you can see.

EXAMINE is short for 'LOOK container' followed by 'LOOK IN container'.
~

0 ORDER~
Syntax: order <character> command
Syntax: order all command

ORDER orders one or all of your charmed followers (including pets) to
perform any command.  The command may have arguments.  You are responsible
for the actions of your followers, and others who attack your followers
will incur the same penalty as if they attacked you directly.

Most charmed creatures lose their aggresive nature (while charmed).

If your charmed creature engages in combat, that will break the charm.
~

0 REST SLEEP STAND WAKE~
Syntax: rest
Syntax: sleep
Syntax: stand
Syntax: wake

These commands change your position.  When you REST or SLEEP, you 
regenerate hit points, mana points, and movement points faster.
However, you are more vulnerable to attack, and if you SLEEP,
you won't hear many things happen.

Use STAND or WAKE to come back to a standing position.  You can
also WAKE other sleeping characters.

For info on the sleep spell, type: 'help sleepspell'.
~

0 GTELL ; REPLY SAY TELL~
Syntax: gtell <message>
Syntax: say   <message>
Syntax: tell  <character> <message>

All of these commands send messages to other players.  GTELL sends a message to
all of the characters in your group, wherever they are, even if they are
sleeping or stunned or dying.  ';' is a synonym for GTELL.

SAY sends a message to all awake players in your room.  The single quote '''
is a synonym for SAY.

TELL sends a message to one awake player anywhere in the world.

REPLY sends a message to the last player who sent you a TELL.  REPLY will work
even if you can't see the player, and without revealing their identity.  This
is handy for talking to invisible or switched immortal players.

0 NOTE NOTES BOARD BOARD NOTEWRITE~
Syntax:board [number|name]                     Shows or changes board.
       note                                    Reads next note.
       note read [number]                      Reads a certain note.
       note remove <number>                    Removes a note written by you.
       note list [number]                      Shows up to number notes.
       note write                              Posts a note.
       note catchup                            Marks all notes in this board read.

These commands are used for the new note system. Instead of just one board, 
there are several, each with its special purpose. 

Changing between the boards is accomplished using the BOARD command. BOARD
without any arguments gives you a list of all boards together with number of
unread message. To change, type BOARD <number> or BOARD <name of the board>.
To read next unread note, type NOTE. To read a note with a specified number,
type NOTE READ <number>.  Typing NOTE while in a board with no unread notes 
shifts you to the next board. Note that unlike the standard note system, a 
note has the same number in NOTE LIST and NOTE READ.

Posting a message is as simple as writing NOTE WRITE. You will be moved into 
interactive mode,  where all you see are prompts for the fields like To:, From: etc. 
You will be automatically put AFK while writing a note.

To see the list of the notes in the current board, type NOTE LIST. Typing
NOTE LIST <number> will list only <number> of the last notes in the area.
You can remove your own note by using NOTE REMOVE <number>. Implementors may
remove other people's notes. Implementors can also select how many  days
their note is kept before being purged. Purging happens automatically at
bootup. Purged notes are not deleted, but saved into a file.

To let only immortals see your note, address it to "imm".

This board system was created by Erwin S. Andreasen, erwin@pip.dknet.dk, aka
Phunk and is freely available. The general outlook was based on Mystic 
Adventure's note system (mud.gel.ulaval.ca 4000).
~ 
0 AUCTION CHAT . MUSIC QUESTION ANSWER SHOUT YELL~
Syntax: auction  <message>
Syntax: chat     <message>
Syntax: music    <message>
Syntax: question <message>
Syntax: answer   <message>
Syntax: shout    <message>
Syntax: yell     <message>

These commands send messages through communication channels to other players.

SHOUT sends a message to all awake players in the world.  To curb excessive
shouting, SHOUT imposes a three-second delay on the shouter.

AUCTION, CHAT, MUSIC, and QUESTION and ANSWER also send messages to all
interested players.  '.' is a synonym for CHAT.  The QUESTION and ANSWER
commands both use the same 'question' channel

YELL sends a message to all awake players within your area.

* Most demons are able to assume the form of a weapon.
* The demons power over death is such that even after they have been 
  decapitated, they are still able to employ a selection of powers.
* The powers of a specific demon vary considerably.  Some are barely more 
  powerful than a common avatar, while others are as strong as the greatest 
  of werewolves or vampires.
* While in hell, a demon is virtually unkillable.
* Demons use warps to get much stronger. To gain warps they use the obtain
  command, although most warps help a demon greatly there are some that
  are the exact oppisite. If this happens the demon must use the redeem
  command to redeem his warps 1 at a time until he has all good warps.
  A demon can type warps to see his new powers gifted from satan.

0 BEAST~

Vampires, like mortals, are creatures of instinct.  However, the 
instincts of the vampire are those of a hunter, not a gatherer.  Vampires 
are the ultimate predators and stand at the apex of the food chain.  
They are highly developed killing machines - the harbringers of death.
For vampires to survive in modern society, however, they must learn to 
keep the Beast in check.  The instincts of violence (the Beast) so 
essential in the wild serve only to endanger the vampire in today's 
complex world.  The Beast's rage has its uses, but the blindness it 
creates far outweighs its benefits.
Vampires struggle to suppress the Beast, but, no matter how hard they 
try, they do not always prevail, and when it gets loose, the havoc it 
creates goes far beyond the horror of any mortal rage.
~

0 FAVOUR SIRE PRINCE~
Syntax: favour <target> <sire/prince>

Favour is an ability available to second generation vampires and vampire 
princes.

granted again if the Antediluvian or Prince so desire.  A childe sired 
without permission is known as an Anarch.

PRINCE turns the target vampire into a prince, who is then able to allow 
other vampires the ability to sire more vampires still.  Only an 
Antediluvian has the power to make some a prince (or to remove the 
prince's powers).

ACCEPT will accept a childe into the clan, making them a Neonate.

INDUCT and OUTCAST will accept an Anarch into the clan or outcast a member.
~

0 DISCIPLINE DISCIPLINES~

Each vampire clan has three disciplines from which their powers come.  In 
addition to these basic three, vampires may learn additional disciplines 
from other vampires.  Only the single clan discipline is passed on to
later
generations.  Each Discipline has several power levels and each level 
must be learnt before the next can be gained.

There are twenty disciplines, each with the following powers:

* Animalism     - Control over Animals

~

0 PROTEAN~

This Discipline allows a vampire to transform either their entire body or 
a part of their body into something inhuman.  The vampire can thus grow 
claws, turn into a bat, transform into a wolf or dissolve into a fine 
mist.  A vampire can use most other Disciplines while shapeshifted, but 
may not cast spells.  Full transformation is not possible during combat, 
although claws can be grown if you are fighting.  While shapeshifted the 
vampire cannot wear any equipment.

The powers available to this Discipline are as follows:
* Umbravision: A combination of truesight shadowsight allows
you to see any hidden charchter accept for monk and ninja.
* Flamehands: This power erupts your hands into flames.
* Earthmeld: Allows you to sink into the ground hiding from enemies.
* Claws: Enables the user to grow inch-long claws on each finger.  These 
claws have no effect if the vampire is armed, however if not they cause 
considerably more damage than a normal unarmed attack.
* Change: Allow the vampire to transform into bat, wolf or mist.  Bat 
form can fly and detect almost everything (invis, hidden, etc).  While in 
wolf form, the vampire enjoys the benefit of an extra 500hp and greatly 
enhanced combat abilities.  Mist form is impervious to attacks and can 
pass through doors.  Beware though, for two vampires in mist form CAN 
attack each other.

are standing in plain view.  Though this Discipline affects others minds 
and does not actually render the users invisible, the end result is much 
the same.  Obfuscate is the opposing Discipline to Auspex, and they 
cancel out many of each others powers.

Kindred with this power gain the following advantages:
* Mask: Allows you to disguise yourself as another player.
* Shield: Protects you from the Auspex 'scry' and 'readaura' powers.
* Mortal: Switches between vampire and mortal mode.  While in mortal 
  form, you loose all vampire advantages and disadvantages, and are

Discipline have the ability to tear out their own hearts, rendering 
themselves immune to being staked.  Serpentis users also gain the ability 
to transform themselves into a giant serpent and back at will.  The third 
ability available to vampires with this Discipline is the ability to run

0 QUIT RENT SAVE~
Syntax: QUIT
Syntax: RENT ... not!
Syntax: SAVE

SAVE saves your character and objects.  You must be a mortal or avatar to
save.  The game will auto-save your character every few minutes whether you
save or not.

Some objects, such as keys and potions, may not be saved.

QUIT leaves the game.  You may QUIT anywhere, although there is an experience
penalty for quitting outside of Midgaard.  When you re-enter the game you will
be back in the same room.

QUIT automatically does a SAVE, so you can safely leave the game with just one
command.  Nevertheless it's a good idea to SAVE before QUIT.  If you get into
the habit of using QUIT without SAVE, and then you play some other mud that
doesn't save before quitting, you're going to regret it.

There is no RENT in this mud.  Just SAVE and QUIT whenever you want to leave.
